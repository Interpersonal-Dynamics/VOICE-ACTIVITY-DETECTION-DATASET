# Voice Activity Detection Dataset

This dataset is a joint work of our research team and is used in our paper titled "Title of the Paper". The dataset contains voice activity data collected from 15 three-member groups (a total of 45 undergraduate students considering gender balance) using commercial voice-recording sensors.

## Abstract

Voice data is of special interest to organizational behavior researchers since it can be easily collected and provides a wealth of information for understanding interpersonal dynamics. Our research focuses on voice activity detection (VAD) using wearable sensor badges. We propose an interpersonal dynamics analysis framework based on low-cost commercial recording sensors, consisting of data-driven VAD modeling and conversational feature extracting. For more details, please refer to our paper.

## Materials

The sensors hung from participantsâ€™ necks and collected univariate frequency data, at a 100 Hz sampling rate with 12 quantization bits. Each group was provided with three-person communication transcripts scenarios. The detailed descriptions of each scenario and the overall conversation structure of each scenario are as follows:

### Descriptions of Three Scenarios

1. Scenario 1: Three people in the group take turns to speak.
2. Scenario 2: Two pairs in the group speak together at different lengths.
3. Scenario 3: All three persons speak together at different lengths.

### Overall structure of conversation scenarios

Each dataset was manually labeled using binary coding to indicate whether the recording devices captured a person speaking (labeled as 1) or not (labeled as 0).
